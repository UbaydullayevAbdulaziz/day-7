                    <p class="hero__text">Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, highlighting
                        stories
                        of coffee from around the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from
                        bean
                        to brew - in every shipment.</p>

                        <p class="commitment__text">We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along
                            the way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at
                            home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we
                            travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and opportunities in each
                            of these places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers and empower a global
                            community of farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training,
                            support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the
                            finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native
                            growing region.</p>
